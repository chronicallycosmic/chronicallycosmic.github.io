<h1>Autumnal Finale</h1>
							<p>Fall Look Two</p>
						</header>
						<p>I was astounded to realize that the first day of winter is December 21st, a day that seems so far away from now. The winter-themed merchandise suddenly available in every store, the rainbow string lights illuminating the streets, and (most notably of all) the frigid weather greeting me every morning, has made it feel as though the season of winter is already upon us.

Certainly, living on a plateau surrounded by mountains – in none other than the quaint town of Blacksburg – has gifted me with a premature winter. But the leaves have not all fallen just yet, and autumn has still to make its finale. Thus, I was inspired by the confusion of the seasons to create this photoshoot featuring a winter outfit in an autumn setting.

This entire experience has caused me to reflect on the nature of fashion itself, and how heavily it relies on the seasons. New collections are usually advertised with the start of every new season, showcasing styles appropriate for the given time.

I wonder how fashion would function in a world without seasons. Would there be less variation in styles? Less creativity? Or would the lack of seasons create a completely different platform for designers to explore fashion in an innovative way? I cannot answer these questions, because I have yet to visit a parallel world in which seasons do not exist.

In order to perpetuate the theme of confusion, as witnessed in the seasonal fluctuations and in my own musings, I included a myriad of different prints in this outfit. However, they were all united under a common monochromatic color scheme. I completed this look with a signature grey coat and long black tie-up boots, making it suitable to wear during the cusp of wintertime and at the end of autumn.</p>
